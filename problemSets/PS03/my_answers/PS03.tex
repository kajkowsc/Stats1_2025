\section*{Question 1}

\noindent We are interested in knowing how the difference in campaign spending between incumbent and challenger affects the incumbent's vote share.

\newpage
			\begin{description}
				\item The model shows a moderate positive association between difference in spending and incumbent's vote share. The R squared value is 0.3673, therefore, the difference of spending isn't a strong predicition on the outcome of the incumbent's vote share. This means 36.73 percent of variation in the incumbent's vote share is explained by the difference in spending. The remaining 63.27 percent of variation is due to other factors that are not included in the model. 
			\end{description}
		\item Save the residuals of the model in a separate object.	\vspace{.5cm}
		\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=56, lastline = 56]{PS03.R}\\
		\item Write the prediction equation. \vspace*{.5cm}
		\begin{equation}
			\widehat{\text{voteshare}}  = 0.579 + 0.042\times \text{difflog} 			
		\end{equation}
		\begin{description}
			\item 	The slope of this equation means that for every 1 unit increase in difference of spending, the incumbent's vote share is predicted to increase 0.042. The constant of 0.579 is the predicted value of the incumbent's vote share when the difference in spending is equal to zero. 
		\end{description}

\section*{Question 2}
\noindent We are interested in knowing how the difference between incumbent and challenger's spending and the vote share of the presidential candidate of the incumbent's party are related.	\vspace{.25cm}

		\begin{description}
	\item The model shows a weak positive association, because this model is more clustered, between difference in spending and the vote share of the presidential candidate of the incumbent's party. The R squared value is 0.08795, therefore, the difference of spending isn't a strong predicition on the outcome of the vote share of the presidential candidate. This means 8.795 percent of variation in the incumbent's vote share is explained by the difference in spending. The remaining 91.205 percent of variation is due to other factors that are not included in the model. 
	\end{description}
		\item Save the residuals of the model in a separate object.	\vspace{.5cm}
			\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline= 77, lastline = 77]{PS03.R}\\
		\item Write the prediction equation.
			\begin{equation}
				\widehat{\text{presvote}}  = 0.508 + 0.024\times \text{difflog}
		\end{equation}
		\begin{description}
			\item 	The slope of this equation means that for every 1 unit increase in difference of spending, the vote share of the presidential candidate is predicted to increase 0.024.

				\item The model shows a moderate positive association between the vote share of the presidential candidate of the incumbent's party and the incumbent's vote share. The R squared value is 0.2058, therefore, the difference of spending isn't a strong predicition on the outcome of the incumbent's vote share. This means 20.58 percent of variation in the incumbent's vote share is explained by the vote share of presidential candidate of the incumbent's party. The remaining 79.42 percent of variation is due to other factors that are not included in the model. 
			\end{description}

\section*{Question 4}
\noindent The residuals from part (a) tell us how much of the variation in \texttt{voteshare} is $not$ explained by the difference in spending between incumbent and challenger. The residuals in part (b) tell us how much of the variation in \texttt{presvote} is $not$ explained by the difference in spending between incumbent and challenger in the district.

		\item Write the prediction equation.
		\begin{equation}
			\widehat{\text{variation in voteshare}}  = -1.942e^{-18} + 0.257\times \text{variation in presvote}
		\end{equation}
		\begin{description}
		\item 	The constant value  $-1.942e^{-18}$ is the predicticted value of variation in voteshare is not explained by the difference in spending when the variation in presvote is not explained by the difference in spending equals zero. For every one unit increase in the variation in presvote not explained by the difference in spending, the variation in voteshare is not explained by the difference in spending is predicted to increase by 0.257.

\section*{Question 5}
\noindent What if the incumbent's vote share is affected by both the president's popularity and the difference in spending between incumbent and challenger? 
	\begin{enumerate}

\newpage		
		\item Write the prediction equation.	\vspace{.5cm}
		\begin{equation}
			\widehat{\text{voteshare}} = 0.449 + 0.036\times\text{difflog} + 0.257\times\text{presvote}
		\end{equation}
		\begin{description}
			\item The constant 0.449 is the predicted value of incumbent's vote share given difference in spending and the vote share of the presidential candidate equals zero. On average, a one unit increase in difference of spending leads to a 0.036 increase in incumbent's vote share, holding everything else constant. On average, a one unit increase in the vote share of the presidential candidate leads to a 0.257 increase in incumbent's vote share, holding everything else constant.   
		\end{description}
		\item What is it in this output that is identical to the output in Question 4? Why do you think this is the case?
		\begin{description}
			\item The output that's identical to the output in Question 4 is the slope for the vote share of the presidential candidate. In Question 4, the model was looking at the variation not explained by difference in spending for both incumbent's vote share and the vote share of the presidential canidate. In this model, we are using the explanatory values of difference of spending and vote share of the presidential canidate to explain the outcome variable of incumbent's vote share. Therefore, the value for vote share of the presidential canidate needs to be a unique contrabution and seperate from any variation it shares with difference in spending.
