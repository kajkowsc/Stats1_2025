# Agenda
# (a.) Descriptive analysis
# (b.) Confidence intervals
# (c.) Significance test for a mean
# (d.) Significance test for a difference in means
### Research Question -----------
# Is there a relationship between education and income?
# Load data
# Selection of variables
# Education: University level education in years
# Income: Monthly net income
# Capital: Whether the person lives in capital or not
### (a.) Descriptive analysis ----------
# First step, look at data
View(df)
head(df)
str(df)
# Step by step
mean(df$income)
var(df$income)
sd(df$income)
sd(df$income)/sqrt(length(df$income))
# Get summary statistics for entire dataset
# Some quick visualizations, to look at distribution
